            The 2007 AT&T 250 was a NASCAR Busch Series stock car race that took place on June 23, 2007. Held at the Milwaukee Mile in West Allis, Wisconsin, the race was the 17th of 35 in the 2007 season of the Busch Series. Aric Almirola (pictured) of Joe Gibbs Racing was the listed winner of the race. Gibbs intended for NASCAR Nextel Cup Series regular Denny Hamlin to run the race, but the Cup Series was racing that weekend at Sonoma Raceway in Sonoma, California, and Hamlin did not arrive in time to start the race. Almirola started instead and ran the first 59 laps before he was pulled out of the car under caution; Hamlin finished the race and came from behind to win after losing a lap to the leaders during the driver change. NASCAR rules state that the driver who starts the race gets credit for the result, making Almirola the official race winner. The driver change frustrated Almirola, who proceeded to leave the track before the race ended. (Full article...)
